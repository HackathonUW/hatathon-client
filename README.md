# Test Runner Client Program

> :warning: This client program downloads shell commands from the internet, forks a shell, and runs them. The security problem with this should be immediately apparent, if not, think of the most evil command possible and imagine someone put it in a test case.
>
> By running this script, you are trusting everyone who has uploaded a test case to the project you are running (as well as our 24-hour hackathon implementation). **Run this at your own risk!**

Invoked as `python3 runner.py <projectid> <sessionid>` by copying the command from our web app into a terminal of your choice.
